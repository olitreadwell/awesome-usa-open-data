# Agent instructions

This repository is a curated list of United States data sources. The list is
`README.md`, and the rules it follows live in the engine at
<https://github.com/olitreadwell/awesome-list-template>.

## Before you change anything

```bash
uv sync --group dev
make hooks-install 2>/dev/null || git config core.hooksPath .githooks
make check
```

## Rules

- Add links in the shape `- [Name](https://example.gov/) - ▦ Data - ○ Open - what it holds.`
  Every entry needs a type tag and an access tag from `awesome.toml`.
- Link the page that holds the data or the documentation, not a department
  homepage or a press release.
- Do not write entry text with a model. Descriptions come from a human.
- Run `make toc` after moving a heading, and never hand-edit table of contents
  lines.
- Point retired tools at where the data lives now, or move them out. Never keep
  an archived tool in the main list.
- Give every GitHub link its stars and last-push date with `make stats`, which
  writes `github-stats.json` and the trailing stats segment. Never hand-write a
  stars number. `make stats-check` verifies both without the network.
- `make sources` mines upstream lists and writes
  `reports/source-candidates.md`. That report is candidates, not entries: a
  human writes the entry, because awesome.re rejects list content written by
  automation.
